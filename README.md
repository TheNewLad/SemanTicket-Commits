# SemanTicket Commits
## Overview
I'm making this for fun but to also create a tool for my team to use. Currently we use CommitLint.io to help use write our PR titles as we move to Semantic Releases. We also add our Jira tickets to the title as well which gets used by our CI to send Slack notifications with the ticket numbers. At the moment, we're figuring out how we want to format the PR titles, so I figured I'd create an opinionated tool for fun.
